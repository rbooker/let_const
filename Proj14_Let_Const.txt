Exercise:
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

/* Write an ES2015 Version */
const PI = 3.14;

Quiz:
1. What is the difference between var and let?

A variable declared with let only exists inside the code block in which it's declared, and while it can be reassigned, it cannot be redeclared.
A variable declared with var exists globally, unless it is declared inside a function, in which case it is scoped to that function. It can be both reassigned and redeclared.

2. What is the difference between var and const?

A variable declared with const is block-scoped, similar to let. It cannot be reassigned or redeclared, although it can be mutated.
A variable declared with var exists globally, unless it is declared inside a function, in which case it is scoped to that function. It can be both reassigned and redeclared.

3. What is the difference between let and const?

A variable declared with let can be reassigned. That's essentially the only difference.

4. What is hoisting?

During compilation, variables declarations made with var are "hoisted" to the top of the file, i.e. they are run before any other code. Function declarations are similarly hoisted.
